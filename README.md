hikeAday creator Mason Wilkins has worked in property management and the real estate industry as a realtor for most of his career. Mason has always had an interest in technology all of his life, and after trying many different career paths, he decided to puruse his love for technology by learning to program by attending a software engineering bootcamp with Hackbright Academy. Mason truly found his way as with this botocamp, he felt he was finally being challenged and his love for an ability to problem solve could be used. Mason is excited for the challanges he will get to overcome and the problems he will have the opportunity to solve after the program. This is her first full-stack project. Mason can be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mwilkins17/) and on [Github](https://github.com/mwilkins17).
